I am a Senior Lecturer in International Relations in the [School of Government & Public Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/governmentpublicpolicy/) and Chancellorâ€™s Fellow in the [Center for Energy Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/centreforenergypolicy/) at the University of Strathclyde. I am also a Fellow at the [Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP)](https://sais-isep.org/), Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and Associated Researcher at the Centre for the [Political Economy of Reforms](https://reforms.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim.

I study central questions in international cooperation and the political economy of environmental politics and energy policy. Current projects include research on the political economy of carbon markets, firm regulation and private politics, the politics of energy transition as well as formal and empirical models of climate treaty-making.

My work was published, among others, in the *Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Energy Economics*, *PNAS*, and *Science Advances*. My book on [Escaping the Energy Poverty Trap](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/escaping-energy-poverty-trap) was published with MIT Press in 2018 and offers the first comprehensive political science account of energy poverty. I have written for *The Washington Post*'s Monkey Cage, VoxDev, and ISEP. My work has been covered by *The Economist*.

My contact details can be found in my [CV here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6npjw6ccyv34ymn/CV_BAYER_current.pdf?dl=0).
