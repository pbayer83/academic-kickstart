I was awarded this year's ["Emerging Young Scholar Award"](https://connect.apsanet.org/s15/step-awards-2/) by the American Political Science Association's (APSA) Section on "Science, Technology & Environmental Politics" (STEP). This award is "given in recognition of a researcher, within 10 years of completing their Ph.D. degree, who is making notable contributions to the field of science, technology, and environmental politics." I am immensely grateful for this outstanding honor.
