I have been awarded a major half a million pounds [ESRC]("https://esrc.ukri.org/") grant to study the "Politics of Science in International Climate Cooperation". Together with [Hannah Hughes]("https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/330670-hughes-hannah") from Cardiff and [Erlend Hermansen]("https://cicero.oslo.no/en/employee/13/erlend-andre-tveiten-hermansen") from CICERO in Oslo, we will study how, when, and with what effect governments may attempt to shape the production and uptake of [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/) climate reports. While much anecdotal evidence of such influence exists, we lack systematic knowledge. Drawing on a wide range of methods, including statistical modelling and cutting edge text-as-data methods as well as participant observation and elite interviews, we will analyse nomination, approval, and uptake processes of the newest [IPCC Assessment Report 6](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/). [CICERO](https://cicero.oslo.no/en) in Norway, [PIK](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home) in Germany, and the [Tyndall Centre](https://www.tyndall.ac.uk/) in the UK will be involved in the dissemination of project findings.
