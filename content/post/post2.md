I have published two new papers, forthcoming in *Energy Research and Social Science*. One is joint work with Alexander Ovodenko on public support for fracking in the United States, titled [“Many Voices in the Room: A National Survey Experiment on How Framing Changes Views toward Fracking in the United States”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629618313057), and the other one is research on the geographic bias in energy access impact evaluations, titled [“Shades of Darkness or Light? A Systematic Review of Geographic Bias in Impact Evaluations of Electricity Access”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629619301665), which is together with David Hamburger, Joel Jaeger, Ryan Kennedy, and Joonseok Yang, and Johannes Urpelainen.
